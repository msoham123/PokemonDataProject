# University of Washington AI4All Final Project

The University of Washington invites students from traditionally underrepresented groups to join us for a free, 2-week data science and artificial intelligence introductory workshop. To be eligible for the program, students must be rising high school juniors, high school seniors, or college freshmen. At the workshop, students will learn how to understand, analyze, interpret  and discuss real-world applications of data science and machine learning with the ultimate goal of understanding impactful technology decisions.

## Introduction

The word *Pokemon* immediately invokes the inner child inside of an individual. Considering that *Pokemon* holds such an important place in many individual's childhoods, can we use the [Pokemon data set](https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon) to answer the following questions?

Research Question 1:
```bash
Can we identify patterns while looking at Attack, Defense, and Speed?
```

Research Question 2:
```bash
If a new Pokemon is found in the wild, can I classify whether it is a legendary pokemon or not?
```

## Usage

With a clone of the repo and python 3.7 installed, you can run this project by...

```python
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install numpy
pip install seaborn

python pokemon.py
```
